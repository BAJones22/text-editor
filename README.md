## Usage 

Upon launching the application, a welcoming user interface awaits you. Here, you can seamlessly initiate the creation and modification of your textual notes or code snippets.

Rest assured, the application embraces next-gen JavaScript practices, upholding its seamless functionality while remaining free of errors.

To enhance accessibility, a convenient "Install" button empowers you to add the PWA to your device. Once installed, you can effortlessly access the application from your home screen.

Behind the scenes, a service worker, powered by workbox, diligently pre-caches static assets. This behind-the-scenes effort culminates in a seamless experience, extending its reach to offline mode as well.
